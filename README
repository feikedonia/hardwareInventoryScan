###Hardware Inventory Scanner

Hardware Inventory Scanner is a set of script using Linux and GNU
    to scan for the hardware specifics of computers running Linux.
    The primary purpose of this tool is to automate the scanning of
    Linux computers from a live USB-stick, this way you can test out
    if Linux works on the device and know the hardware specs before
    buying the device, for example.

This scanner is intended to work without access to internet, but for
    the time being, you need to download it with `git clone` and it
    won't keep the results on the USB-stick, since I haven't figured
    out how persistent USB-stick work yet.

After and during the scanning with this tool, it will save variables
    and results to a /tmp/hardwareScan/ folder on the local machine,
    if the folder doesn't exist, it will create one. Once the you
    can `cat` out the results in the /tmp/hardwareScan/ folder.

### Targeted platforms
    * x86-64 machines
    * Linux live USB-stick
    * Systemd is a requirement




The script expects the usage of one of the following distributions:
    * Arch and derivatives (manjaro may not work)
    * Fedora and derivatives
    * Debian testing and sid (stable may not work)
    * Debian testing and sid derivatives, like ubuntu

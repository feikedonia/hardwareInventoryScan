###Hardware Inventory Scanner

Hardware Inventory Scanner is a set of scripts using Linux and GNU
    toolkits to scan computers' hardware specifics. The primary
    purpose of this project is to automate scanning of linux computers
    to know there specs, before selling them. The default bebaviour
    of the scripts is scanning, and confirting the stdout to json as
    much as possible.
   
The script expects the usage of one of the following distrubutions:
    * Arch and derivatives (manjaro may not work)
    * Fedora and derivatives
    * Debian testing and sid (stable may not work)
    * Debian testing and sid derivatives, like ubuntu
    
This project shall be avialable on github under an opensource and
    copyleft licence, which shall enable me to recieve modification
    from others. If someone wants to distubute my code alongside their
    (proprietary) code they can use the opencore model.
